Scalable and robust Datapipeline for plc's
# Introduction 
Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC's) are in the automation state-of-the-art. PLC's control plants and facilities and are important for the information exchange in the control level of automation hierarchy. The automation hierarchy seperates the responsibilities but restricts information sharing between the layers and plants. To get around the limitation of information sharing, there are new opportunities for Industrial IoT that include use with PLCs, cloud solutions and Big Data technologies. 

# Use-Case
Industrial PLCs are used for control in power generation and distribution plants. For this, there are some concepts and possibilities to adapt industrial PLCs for Industry 4.0 scenarios. These concepts can also be applied for power generation and distribution plants.
The Use-Case for the application is predictive and preventive analysis and maintenance to ensure reliable operations and save costs on service calls.

# Goals
The goal is to build a data pipeline for plcs. It must be able to collect and analyze a large amount of data, such as alarms, inputs and outputs from industrial PLCs for example in power generation and power distribution systems. Since not all architecture goals can be achieved, the focus for the system architecture is on scalability and robustness.
